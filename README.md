# SwiftUI Adaptive UI with Animations

## Project Description
This SwiftUI project demonstrates the use of custom UI components, adaptive layouts, and advanced animations. It includes:
- Reusable UI components created with `@ViewBuilder`.
- A responsive UI using `GeometryReader` for dynamic scaling across different screen sizes and orientations.
- Smooth animations and transitions with `.matchedGeometryEffect()`.
- A `TabView` for seamless navigation and data management between screens.

## Features
### 1. Custom UI Components
- Created multiple reusable SwiftUI views using `@ViewBuilder`.
- Modularized UI design for better code organization and reusability.
- Utilized these components in different screens to maintain consistency.

### 2. Adaptive & Responsive Layouts
- Used `GeometryReader` to adapt UI dynamically based on screen size.
- Implemented `LazyVGrid` and `LazyHGrid` for efficient rendering of grid-based layouts.
- Ensured support for different device orientations and screen resolutions.

### 3. Advanced Animations & Effects
- Implemented `.matchedGeometryEffect()` for smooth and visually appealing animations.
- Added interactive UI elements with gestures and transitions to enhance user experience.

### 4. TabView Implementation
- Integrated a `TabView` to navigate between multiple screens.
- Managed data transfer between tabs efficiently.
